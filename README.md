# CLI_ProcessDetectionModule
CLI ProcessDetectionModule, is a module what will do the same as I developed within C# ProcessDetectionModule which is kill the game process once the cheat process is detected. But the difference is this is written within CLI C+ which means you can run and call this from managed and unmanaged source code.
